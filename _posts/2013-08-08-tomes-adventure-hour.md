Now that the Toronto Fringe Festival has come and gone for another year, the Tomes Adventure Hour returns to its regularly scheduled programming! Join us at the Central on the second Thursday of August for performances from some of our favourite nerdy acts. This month:

- Connor Low and Molly Davis
- History Buffs
- Hosted by Diana Bailey

And, of course, Tomes! Watch as we work our dangerous necromancy to breathe new life into a long-dead fantasy novel, purely for your enjoyment!
