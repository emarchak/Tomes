February - the month of lovers. For this romantic month, Tomes will be dusting off their collection of old Harlequin Romance novels and performing the trashiest of romances before your very eyes. Yes, bring your smelling salts as this month is going to be as seductive and sultry as we can make it.


"NNN ... a killer hook ... their geeky sleeve-worn enthusiasm shines through."
- NOW Magazine

"(They are) turning judging a book by its cover into an extreme sport."
- Globe & Mail

"Energetic... Committed... I would certainly go see it again."
- Mooney On Theatre

Tomes are improvised adaptations of (the covers of) forgotten paperback fantasy novels, stories that will never be read or repeated. Seven brave, clever improvisers emerge from the darkness with a box full of books they have never read... and never will. An equally brave and clever audience member chooses one of these books. Then the entire book is performed live onstage before your very eyes!

Every show is based on a different book and is a completely new adventure! It's thrilling, hilarious, and sometimes even accidentally accurate.

Featuring the talents of:

[Calvinball](https://www.facebook.com/CalvinballComedy) - is an organic, longform, improv comedy troupe in Toronto

Amanda Day - has been plying her brand of smart, silly, and very dirty comedy stylings for six years.
