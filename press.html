<p>A young peasant is on a hero's journey, except the peasant is a dance prodigy. An evil wizard plots to conquer the world, but he's just trying to impress a blind date. Maybe a princess embarks on a legendary search for the perfect friendship bracelet? That can work.</p>
<p>Secretly Illiterate Theatre's Tomes is a longform improv comedy show like none other. The players begin with a box of paperback fantasy novels, none of which they have ever read. An audience member selects a book from the box and the cast reads the back cover out loud for all to hear. They return the book to the person who picked it. It is theirs to keep forever. Then... the cast performs the entire book,beginning to end, creating universes of lonely pixies with relationship troubles, wizards who think taking over the world will impress a blind date, werewolf nightclub owners, and more dragons than you can possibly imagine. Judging a book by its cover has never been so hilarious.</p>
