It's back-to-school time, but Tomes sure as hell isn't hitting the books. Come join us at the Central on the second Thursday of September for performances from some of our favourite nerdy acts. This month:

- Improv duo Todd Charron and Dimetre Alexiou
- Longform improv from New Becky
- Hosted by Jamie O'Connor

And, of course, Tomes! Watch as we work our dangerous necromancy to breathe new life into a long-dead fantasy novel, purely for your enjoyment!

The Tomes Adventure Hour
7:00 PM on the second Thursday of every month
