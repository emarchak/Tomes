"NNN ... a killer hook ... their geeky sleeve-worn enthusiasm shines through."
- NOW Magazine

"(They are) turning judging a book by its cover into an extreme sport."
- Globe & Mail

"Energetic... Committed... I would certainly go see it again."
- Mooney On Theatre

Tomes are improvised adaptations of (the covers of) forgotten paperback fantasy novels, stories that will never be read or repeated. Seven brave, clever improvisers emerge from the darkness with a box full of books they have never read... and never will. An equally brave and clever audience member chooses one of these books. Then the entire book is performed live onstage before your very eyes!

Every show is based on a different book and is a completely new adventure! It's thrilling, hilarious, and sometimes even accidentally accurate.

This month we've got an improv sandwich with improv filling for you! We love NEW BECKY and so will you, and we love LIZ JOHNSTON AND JESS BRYSON and so will you!
