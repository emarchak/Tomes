As time turns to that of All Hallow's Eve, we turn inwards, not to our colons but to our minds and examine that which is deep and dark inside. Again, I remind you, not in the colons, but in the minds. Yes, indeed, in this session we examine our deepest, darkest phobias in a similar infernal* region (basement venue) of The Crown and Tiger. - Penmoor, on behalf of the Brainiacs (Bylli Batson and Trent Jackson)


We are joined by:
